### Hi there 👋


## ✨ About Me ✨
<p align="left">

  I'm a self thought Programmer 👨‍💻

  I'm currently working as a freelance software developer 🚀, mostly making webscrapers 🕸️ and all sort of bots 🤖

  I'm always curious about new tools I can implement in my programs

  What I love the most about programming is automation, and the exciting feeling you get when a hard and boring task disappears with a few lines of code!
